## Model View Controller: Framework for Web Apps

### 3 parts of the model View Controller

- ___The View___ is the part of the app that handles the display or output of the data. The View is often designed after the model data so that it makes sense when it displays that data.

- ___The Controller___ is the part of the application that handles user interaction. The controller can handle user input and read data it receives from the view, then send those inputs to the model.

- ___The Model___ is the part of the app that handles the logic and processes application data. It usually also works with a database to handle retrieving and storing data.
